What did I work on in the last three days? 
   - Made a list of bugs needed to be fixed in my classes
   - Started working on fixing those bugs in Mkdir and Echo

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
   - Continue checking for errors/bugs in Cd, Mkdir, Echo class
   - Create JavaDoc for cd, mkdir, echo, command
   - Make sure all the code is following the rubric format given

Am I blocked on anything?
