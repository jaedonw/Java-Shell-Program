What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Finished new product backlog for Assignemnt2B with team
    - Finished making sprint 4 backlog with team
    - Group meeting to breakdown and assign tasks to everyone
    - Updated CRC cards to account for new FileSystem class
    - Added CRC card for Rm class
    - Coded the Rm class to implement the rm command

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Add file redirection for history command
    - Add file redirection for ls command
    - Add the -R (recursive) option for ls command 

Am I blocked on anything?
    - I need to understand how my group members are implementing their file redirection, so my classes are consistant
    - I need to brainstorm more on how to introduce recursion in the ls command
