What did I work on in the last three days?
    - finished coding man class
    - continued coding cat class
    - improved pwd class
    - improved speak class
    - planned and prepared for demo with TA
    - worked on sprint 3 backlog

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - begin/continue testing man, cat, pwd, speak, and JShell for errors
    - implement single quotation mark support for speak
    - begin implementing . and .. support for cat
    - begin writing Javadocs (pwd, man, cat, speak)
Am I blocked on anything?
