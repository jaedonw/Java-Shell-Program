What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Added tests to Exit, Pushd, File, ErrorChecker, and Interpreter classes
    - Tested JShell program thoroughly
    - Made modifications to JavaDoc and method comments
    - Added a method to Interpreter

What do I plan to work in the next three days?

Am I blocked on anything?
