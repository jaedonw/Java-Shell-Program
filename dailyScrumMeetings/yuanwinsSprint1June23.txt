What did I work on in the last three days? 
   - worked on Cd class and got the skeleton code ready to be implemented
   - modified crc cards to reflect the design we plan

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
   - continue working on Cd class
   - start working on new task for sprint 2 
	- cd class
	- all 3 cases of echo class
	- mkdir class

Am I blocked on anything? 
   - deciding how Cd will change the path to its desired location
   - deciding how I would make a new directory class
