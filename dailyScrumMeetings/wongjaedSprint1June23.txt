What did I work on in the last three days?
    - brainstormed ideas for implementations of all classes
    - brainstormed ideas for data/memory management
    - Worked on coding File, Mkdir, and Command classes
    - Worked on CRC cards for Speak and Mkdir
    - Removed CRC card for FileSystem

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Create a CRC card for Interpreter and implement the Interpreter class
    - Implement the ErrorChecker class
    - Continue working on the File class
    - Work on the JShell class
    - Help team members decide on how to implement command classes

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need to think more about how traversals will work within our file system to get a better understanding of how to
      implement other classes
