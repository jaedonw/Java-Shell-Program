What did I work on in the last three days?
    - brainstormed Sprint 5 with group members
    - added new man class documentation (save, load, find)
    - updated existing man class documentation
    - added output redirection for pwd

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
   - modify existing CRC cards
   - begin writing JUnit tests and JavaDocs for cat, man, pwd, speak, curl, and exit
   - begin coding load class

Am I blocked on anything?
