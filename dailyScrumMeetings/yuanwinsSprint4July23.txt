What did I work on in the last three days? 
   - created crc cards for mv and tree
   - implemented the mv and tree command
   - decide what tasks we will be working next sprint

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
   - refactor cd, echo, mkdir, mv, tree classes if needed
   - fix the cd error found from assignment 2A
   - write JUnit test for cd, echo, mkdir, mv, tree and search for bugs
   - update java doc for cd, echo, mkdir, mv, tree if needed
   - make crc card for find
   - implement the find command
   - fix echo and tree command to redirect output properly

Am I blocked on anything?
