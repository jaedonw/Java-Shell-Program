What did I work on in the last three days? 
   - decided with group what we will be working on this sprint
   - echo now uses the general redirection method from file
   - mkdir now supports creation of multiple directories
   - brainstormed ideas on implementation of tree and mv commands

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
   - create crc card for mv and tree
   - implement the mv and tree command

Am I blocked on anything? 
   -
