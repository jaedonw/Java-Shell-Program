What did I work on in the last three days?
    - began coding/implementing Speak class (with help from geeksforgeeks.org)
    - modified Speak class for use (multiple calls from JShell)
    - began coding man class 

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - finish coding man class
    - begin implementing a directory stack system in JShell
    - continue/finish coding cat class (error check)
    - prepare for sprint 3

Am I blocked on anything?
