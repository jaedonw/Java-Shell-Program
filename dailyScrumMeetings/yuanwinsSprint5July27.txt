What did I work on in the last three days? 
   - Fixed cd error found in assignment 2A
   - Made crc card for find
   - Implemented the find command
   - Updated echo, tree to work with file redirection
   - Made changes to cd, echo, mkdir, mv, tree

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
   - Refactor cd, echo, mkdir, mv, tree classes if needed
   - Update Javadoc for cd, echo, mkdir, mv, tree if needed
   - Write JUnit test for cd, echo, mkdir, mv, tree, find and search for bugs

Am I blocked on anything? 
   - Figuring out how to write JUnit tests for some commands
