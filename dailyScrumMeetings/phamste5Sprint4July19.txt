What did I work on in the last three days?
    - brainstormed Sprint 4 with group members
    - added new man class documentation (rm, mv, cp, curl, tree)
    - added curl CRC card
    - began coding curl class (error checking, making new file, URL retrieval)

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
   - continue testing curl class
   - finish documentation for man class
   - implement output redirection for man, pwd, and cat

Am I blocked on anything?
