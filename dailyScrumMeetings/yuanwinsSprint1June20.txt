What did I work on in the last three days? 
   - collaborated with team to decide which classes we would need
   - worked on JShell
      - created an interpreter to read user input and break it down into two components, command name and arguments
   - completed CRC cards for popd, pushd, history, ErrorChecker

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
   - finish up the pwd and cd class
   - start working on new tasks for sprint 2
      - decide which classes would be most beneficial to us, so that we can implement it next

Am I blocked on anything? 
   - need a prototype of directory class to get an idea on how to create the cd class
