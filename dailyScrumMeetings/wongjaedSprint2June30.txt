What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Modified code to ErrorChecker, JShell, and Command classes
    - Added methods in File and Interpreter classes
    - Helped team members brainstorm ideas for Mkdir, Cd, Pwd, Cat, Pushd, Popd

What do I plan to work in the next three days?

Am I blocked on anything?
