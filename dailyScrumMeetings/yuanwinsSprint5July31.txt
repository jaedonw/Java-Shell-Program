What did I work on in the last three days? 
   - Started working on JUnit for cd, echo, mkdir, mv, tree
   - Reviewed the Javadocs and made changes when needed

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
   - Make "Find" JUnit test
   - Finish JUnit testing and find bugs in current code
   - Make any necessary changes to commands (ie, fixing bugs, javadocs etc.)

Am I blocked on anything?
