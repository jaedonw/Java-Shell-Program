What did I work on in the last three days?
    - created CRC card for Load class
    - added JavaDoc for Curl class
    - modified String return for Cat, Pwd, Man, and Speak
    - began coding load class

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
   - finish coding Load class
   - continue testing for bugs in Cat, Pwd, Man, Speak, and Exit
   - begin writing JUnit tests

Am I blocked on anything?
