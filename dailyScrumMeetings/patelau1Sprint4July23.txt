What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Updated CRC cards to account for changes
    - Added file redirection to history command
    - Added file redirectiom to ls command
    - Implemented the recursive option (-R) to ls command
    - Fixed bugs in Rm class to correct rm command execution

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Have group meeting with team to complete Sprint 5 backlog
    - Refactor any code written by me if needed
    - Write JUnit Tests for Ls, History, Popd, Directory, Rm, Command classes
    - Format all code of the project to Google Java Style Code
    - Write/Update Javadocs for Ls, History, Popd, Directory, Rm, Command classes
    - Make CRC card for save command
    - Create CRC card for entity to handle output redirection
    - Update Ls and History class to work with the output redirection entity

Am I blocked on anything?
    - How exactly is the save command going to be implemented 
    - What we can do to better handle output redirection
    - How to best create JUnit tests for out classes
