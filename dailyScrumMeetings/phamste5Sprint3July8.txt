What did I work on in the last three days?
    - continually improved pwd, man, cat, speak
    - implemented main methods for testing for pwd, man, cat, speak
    - wrote JavaDocs for pwd, man, cat, speak
    - implemented . and .. support for cat

What do I plan to work in the next three days?

Am I blocked on anything?
