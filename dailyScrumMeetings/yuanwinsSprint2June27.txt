What did I work on in the last three days? 
   - Almost completed Cd class, just need to test for smaller details
   - Started working on Echo class
   - Started working on Mkdir class

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
   - Finish up Cd, Echo and Mkdir
   - Figuring out how to use other methods to check if Cd received a valid path and if its a directory

Am I blocked on anything? 
   - Figure out a way to implement Echo class with its 3 cases
