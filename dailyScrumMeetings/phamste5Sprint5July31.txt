What did I work on in the last three days?
    - modified existing CRC Cards
    - added output redirection methods to Cat, Pwd, and Man classes
    - continued testing for bugs in Cat, Pwd, Man, Speak, Exit
    - finished coding Load class

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
   - continue testing for bugs in Cat, Pwd, Man, Speak, Load, and Exit
   - begin writing JUnit tests

Am I blocked on anything?
