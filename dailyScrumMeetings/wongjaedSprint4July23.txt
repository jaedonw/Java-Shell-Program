What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Finished almost all of Cp command implementation
	- Refactored the Interpreter class 
	- Brainstormed ideas for save, load, and find command implementations
	- Communicated with teammates to brainstorm ideas, and keep track of workflow

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- Finish Cp command implementation
	- Finalize design for output redirection and help team implement its class or interface
	- Finalize how the save command will work and implement it

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Need to figure out how to make all important parts of a JShell session serializable to implement save and load
	- Need to figure out how exactly output redirection will work to implement it for all output producing commands
