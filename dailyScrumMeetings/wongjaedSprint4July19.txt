What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Commited Product and Sprint backlogs
    - Created a CRC card and class for FileSystem
	- Modified some classes to collaborate with FileSystem
	- Created a CRC card and class for cp command (Cp class)
	- Brainstormed ideas about various new command implementations with team

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- Implement the Cp command
	- Refactor Interpreter class
	- Brainstorm ideas for save, load, and find command implementations
	- Help teammates if needed, and ensure team is on the right track

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Must get a better idea of how save, load, and find commands will be implemented in order to plan the next sprint
	- Need to figure out how to use Reflection to refactor Interpreter class so that adding new commands becomes easier
