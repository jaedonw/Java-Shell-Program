What did I work on in the last three days?
    - brainstormed the design and decided what CRC cards we needed with team. 
    - worked on JShell and exit command by starting to write base code.
    - brainstormed design ideas with team for how to process commands and classes related FileSystem. 

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - finish JShell and exit command completely.
    - work on new tasks for sprint 2.
    - begin coding Directory class.
    - help with coming up with ideas for History, FileSystem, and File classes for their implementation. 

Am I blocked on anything?
    - I need help on coming up with a better design for Directory and FileSystem related classes.
