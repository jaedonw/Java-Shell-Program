What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Made a CRC card for Interpreter
    - Made and coded a class for Interpreter
    - Coded a class for ErrorChecker
    - Added methods and a instance variable to File class
    - Updated a subset of the CRC cards
    - Updated JShell to keep track of important directories
    - Added code to Exit class
    - Brainstormed ideas with others on implementations for classes such as Mkdir

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Brainstorm ideas with other on implementations for Cd class, Echo class, and others
    - Continue updating CRC cards to match their implementations
    - Continue working on the File, Interpreter, and ErrorChecker classes
    - Plan the backlog for sprint 3

Am I blocked on anything?
