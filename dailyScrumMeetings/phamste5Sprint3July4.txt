What did I work on in the last three days?
    - brainstormed/discussed sprint 3 tasks with team
    - tested classes for errors (man, cat, pwd, speak, JShell)
    - implemented single quotation mark support for Speak class

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - continue testing man, cat, pwd, speak, and JShell for errors
    - begin implementing . and .. support for cat
    - begin writing Javadocs (pwd, man, cat, speak)

Am I blocked on anything?
