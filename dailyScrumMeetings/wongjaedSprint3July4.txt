What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Implemented the Pushd command
    - Added JavaDoc to File, Interpreter, ErrorChecker, Exit, and Pushd classes
    - Tested program and informed team of any errors
    - Fixed a bug in Interpreter

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Continue testing, fixing bugs, and helping teammates brainstorm ideas on how to refactor code
    - Check that all code and program functionality aligns with the assignment handout

Am I blocked on anything?
