User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) As a user, I want to redirect the output of a command so that I can overwrite or append to a file.
b) As a user, I want to remove a directory from the file system.
c) As a user, I want to create multiple directories, all at the same time.
d) As a user, I want to view the contents of a directory, including the contents of all of its subdirectories.
e) As a user, I want to change the location of a file or directory.
f) As a user, I want to create a copy of a file or directory.
g) As a user, I want to view the contents of a single file or multiple files at once.
h) As a user, I want to add a file located at a web address to my directory.
i) As a user, I want to see a visual representation of the file system in the form of a tree.
j) As a user, I want to read a manual for a command, so that I can understand what it does and how to use it.
